/**
 * Bubble sort.
 * 
 * Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works
 * by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them
 * if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates
 * that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
 * Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple,
 * most of the other sorting algorithms are more efficient for large lists.
 * 
 * Best case: O(n).
 * Average case: O(n^2).
 * Worst case: O(n^2).
