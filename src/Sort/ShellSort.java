/**
 * Shell sort.
 * 
 * Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort.
 * It generalizes an exchanging sort, such as insertion or bubble sort, by starting the comparison
 * and exchange of elements with elements that are far apart before finishing with neighboring elements.
 * Starting with far apart elements can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple
 * nearest neighbor exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959.
 * The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For many practical variants,
 * determining their time complexity remains an open problem.
 * 
 * Best case: Depends on gap sequence.
 * Average case: Depends on gap sequence.
 * Worst case: Depends on gap sequence.
 *
